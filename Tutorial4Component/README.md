Tutorial 4 - Components
-----------------------
A component is made up of three parts:-

 1. **Template** - The view. This is created using HTML and will be the user interface for your application.
 2. **Class** - The code that supports the view. This is written in TypeScript. The class contains data properties and methods to control the logic of the view.
 3. **Metadata** - Contains information for Angular to decide whether it is a component or just a regular class. The metadata is defined using a decorator. A decorator is just a function that provides information about the class attached to it. For components, we use the Component decorator.
